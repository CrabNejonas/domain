# domain â€“ A DNS library for Rust

[![Current](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/domain.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/domain)
[![Documentation](https://docs.rs/domain/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/domain)

A library for interacting with the Domain Name System. The crate contains
an ever-growing set of building blocks for including DNS functionality in
applications.

Currently, these blocks include:

* basic data structures and functionality for creating and parsing DNS
  data and messages,
* support for signing and verifying messages using the TSIG mechanism,
* experimental support for reading data from DNS master files (also known
  as zone files),
* experimental and as yet incomplete support for DNSSEC signing and
  validation,
* a simple Tokio-based stub resolver. This resolver currently resides in
  the [domain-resolv](https://crates.io/crates/domain-resolv) due to
  compiler restrictions but will be merged into this crate soon.
