# domain

A family of crates (eventually) providing a comprehensive DNS library for
Rust.

This crate collects all these crates into one single handy crate under a
common parent. These crates are:

* [domain-core], containing the core data structures and functionality for
  handling DNS data.
* [domain-resolv], an asynchronous stub resolver.

Additional crates will be added over time.
