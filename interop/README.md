# Interoperability Testing for the `domain` Crate

This project provides the scaffolding and actual test cases for testing
the interoperability of the `domain` crate with various other DNS
implementations out there. As such, it is not intended to be published on
*crates.io* but rather is run as part of the CI tests. It also provides
support for testing new features.
