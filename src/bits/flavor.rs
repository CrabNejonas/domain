//! The flavors of DNS data.
//!
//! Because of the various types of domain names, all DNS data comes
//! in one of three flavors: it can be `Owned`, that is, entirely
//! self-contained; `Ref` when its data references an underlying bytes
//! slice; `Lazy` when its data references an underlying DNS message and
//! domain names can be compressed.
//!
//! This module defines the `Flavor` trait for referencing these three
//! flavors as well as the actual flavors as types.
