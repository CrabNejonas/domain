//! # Record Data of Well-defined Record Types
//!
//! This module will eventually contain implementations for the record data
//! for all defined resource record types.
//!
//! The types are named identically to the [`iana::Rtype`] variant they
//! implement. They are grouped into submodules for the RFCs they are defined
//! in. All types are also re-exported at the top level here. Ie., for the
//! AAAA record type, you can simple `use domain_core::rdata::Aaaa` instead of
//! `use domain_core::rdata::rfc3596::Aaaa` which nobody could possibly
//! remember. There are, however, some helper data types defined here and
//! there which are not re-exported to keep things somewhat tidy.
//!
//! See the [`iana::Rtype`] enum for the complete set of record types and,
//! consequently, those types that are still missing.

#[macro_use]
mod macros;

// The rdata_types! macro (defined in self::macros) reexports the record data
// types here and creates the MasterRecordData and AllRecordData enums
// containing all record types that can appear in master files or all record
// types that exist.
//
// All record data types listed here MUST have the same name as the
// `Rtype` variant they implement â€“ some of the code implemented by the macro
// relies on that.
//
// Add any new module here and then add all record types in that module that
// can appear in master files under "master" and all others under "pseudo".
// Your type can be generic over an octet type "O" and a domain name type "N".
// Add these as needed.
//
// Each type entry has to be followed by a comma, even the last one. The macro
// is messy enough as it is ...
